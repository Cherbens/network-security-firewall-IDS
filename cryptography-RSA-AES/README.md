# Cryptography: RSA and AES Implementation

This project implements two common cryptographic algorithms: RSA for asymmetric encryption and AES for symmetric encryption. It demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Features
- RSA: Key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- AES: Encryption and decryption of text using a secret key.
