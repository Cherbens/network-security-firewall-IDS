# Network Security: Firewall & Intrusion Detection

This project demonstrates how to configure a firewall using `iptables` and set up Snort as an IDS to monitor and log suspicious network activities.

## Features
- Firewall rules to block/allow specific IP ranges.
- Snort-based IDS with rules to detect specific attacks (e.g., SYN Flooding).
